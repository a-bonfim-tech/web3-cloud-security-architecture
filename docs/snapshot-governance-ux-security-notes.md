# Snapshot Governance UX — Security & Clarity Notes - Operator-focused notes for safer participation

## Problem
Recurring confusion around voting power, message signing,
and eligibility creates UX friction and security risk that directly affects governance participation and trust

## Risks
- Blind message signing
- Off-chain vs on-chain misinterpretation
- Governance disengagement
- Phishing amplification

## Principles
- Explicit mental models (what is signed, when, why)
- Least surprise in wallet prompts
- Identity ≠ execution
- Transparent governance semantics

## Recommendations
- Inline explanation of voting power calculation
- Clear distinction between signature and transaction
- Canonical explorer links as default actions instead of embedded metadata
- Consistent terminology across UI/docs

## Outcome
Lower confusion, safer participation, higher governance trust.
